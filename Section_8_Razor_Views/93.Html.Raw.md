# Html.Raw Usage Summary

## Overview
The `Html.Raw` method in ASP.NET is used to render raw HTML content in a view. This method is helpful when you want to display HTML code directly in the output without encoding it. 

## Key Concepts

- **Html Encoding**: By default, Razor views encode HTML to prevent script injection and other security issues. However, there are cases where you need to bypass this encoding to display raw HTML content. `Html.Raw` allows you to do that.
  
- **Usage of Html.Raw**: When you have a string containing HTML content and you want that HTML to be rendered in the browser instead of being treated as a plain text, you wrap the string with `Html.Raw`.

## Code Example

### Without Html.Raw (HTML is encoded)
```csharp
<p>@("<b>Bold Text</b>")</p> 
```
Output: 
```
<p>&lt;b&gt;Bold Text&lt;/b&gt;</p>
```

### With Html.Raw (HTML is rendered as is)
```csharp
<p>@Html.Raw("<b>Bold Text</b>")</p> 
```
Output: 
```
<p><b>Bold Text</b></p>
```

## Important Notes:
- **Security Warning**: Use `Html.Raw` with caution. Always ensure that the content being rendered is safe and not user-generated, as this could open your application to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
- **Common Use Cases**: Displaying preformatted HTML content stored in a database, rendering complex HTML strings, or using partial HTML templates in views.
