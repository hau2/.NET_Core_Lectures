# Asp.Net Core Razor Views - For Loop Example

This lesson focuses on demonstrating how to use the `for` loop within Razor views in an Asp.Net Core application.

## Using the `for` Loop in Razor Views

- The `for` loop allows you to repeat a block of HTML or code for a specific number of iterations, based on a collection or a numeric limit.
- In Razor views, the syntax is similar to C#, with the only difference being that you prefix the loop with `@`.

### Example:

In this example, a list of `Person` objects is iterated over using the `for` loop to display the first two people from the list:

```csharp
@using ViewsExample.Models
@{
    List<Person> people = new List<Person>()
    {
        new Person() { Name = "John", DateOfBirth = DateTime.Parse("2000-05-06"), PersonGender = Gender.Male},
        new Person() { Name = "Linda", DateOfBirth = DateTime.Parse("2005-01-09"), PersonGender = Gender.Female},
        new Person() { Name = "Susan", DateOfBirth = DateTime.Parse("2008-07-12"), PersonGender = Gender.Other}
    };
}

@for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
{
    var person = people[i];
    <p>@person.Name was born on @person.DateOfBirth.ToShortDateString() and identifies as @person.PersonGender.</p>
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Declaration**: The loop control variable (`i` in this case) is declared as part of the `for` statement.
2. **Condition**: The loop runs while the condition (`i < 2`) is true.
3. **Iteration**: The loop increments the control variable (`i++`) on each iteration.
4. **Usage**: Inside the loop, you can reference the list or collection using the index `i`, similar to standard C# code.

### Advantages of Using `for` Loop in Razor

- Allows control over the number of iterations and the specific items being processed.
- Ideal for scenarios where you need to limit the output to a certain number of elements or work with specific indices in a collection.
- Razor maintains its flexibility and integration with C# by allowing you to write clear and concise loops within HTML.
