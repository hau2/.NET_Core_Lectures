# Strongly Typed Views - Part 2 Summary

## Overview
In this lesson, the focus shifts to **Strongly Typed Views** for individual model objects rather than collections. This allows for a view to be tightly coupled with a specific single object from a model class, such as a single `Person` rather than a list of `Person`.

## Key Concepts

- **Single Object Strongly Typed View**: You can bind a view to a specific single model object. For instance, instead of binding the view to a `List<Person>`, it can be bound to a single `Person` object.

- **Route Parameters**: You can pass route parameters (such as a person's name or ID) to fetch the corresponding model object and display it in the view.

- **Reusability**: Although code reusability is encouraged, sometimes redundant collections are used in action methods for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, services and business logic should handle fetching data.

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example 1: Declaring a Strongly Typed View for a Single Object

In the view:
```csharp
@model Person

<h1>@Model.Name</h1>
<p>Gender: @Model.Gender</p>
<p>Date of Birth: @Model.DateOfBirth?.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy") ?? "N/A"</p>
```

### Example 2: Supplying a Single Object from the Controller

In the controller:
```csharp
public IActionResult Details(string name)
{
    List<Person> people = GetPeople(); // Assume this gets a collection
    Person matchingPerson = people.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == name);

    if (matchingPerson == null)
    {
        return Content("Person not found.");
    }

    return View(matchingPerson); // Passing the model to the view
}
```

### Example 3: Generating Dynamic URLs for Details View

In the index view, generate dynamic links for each person:
```html
@foreach (var person in Model)
{
    <a href="/person-details/@person.Name">Details</a>
}
```

### Example 4: Back Button Implementation in Details View

In the details view, add a back button to navigate to the home page:
```html
<a href="/home">Back to Home</a>
```

## Advantages of Strongly Typed Views for Single Objects

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the view is working with a specific model type, reducing errors.
- **IntelliSense Support**: Full IntelliSense support while accessing the model properties in the view.
- **Clean Code**: By binding to a single object, you eliminate the need for `ViewBag` or `ViewData` and avoid manual typecasting.
- **Compile-Time Checking**: Property names are checked at compile time, catching errors early.

## Conclusion
In this part, strongly typed views are extended to handle individual model objects rather than collections, making it easier to work with specific entities such as displaying detailed information for a single person. This approach simplifies code, increases safety, and improves maintainability by coupling views directly to model classes.
