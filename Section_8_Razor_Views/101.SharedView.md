# Shared Views in ASP.NET MVC

## Overview

In ASP.NET MVC, a shared view is a view that is accessible by all controllers within the application. These shared views are placed in the `Shared` folder within the `Views` directory. This folder is special because any view placed in it becomes accessible from any controller in the application.

### Example Scenario

Consider an application with two controllers: `HomeController` and `ProductsController`. Both controllers need to render the same view. Instead of duplicating the view file in both the `Home` and `Products` folders, you can place the view inside the `Shared` folder.

#### Steps:
1. Right-click on the `Views` folder and select "Add New Folder."
2. Name the folder `Shared` (this name is fixed).
3. Place the common view (e.g., `All.cshtml`) in the `Shared` folder.

```csharp
// HomeController.cs
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult AllProducts()
    {
        // Returns the 'All.cshtml' view
        return View("All");
    }
}

// ProductsController.cs
public class ProductsController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult All()
    {
        // Returns the 'All.cshtml' view
        return View("All");
    }
}
```

Now, the view is accessible from both controllers, as well as any other controller within the application.

## View Resolution Process

When an action method in a controller returns a view, ASP.NET MVC follows a specific process to locate the view file.

1. **Primary Search Location**: It first looks for the view in the folder that corresponds to the controller name inside the `Views` folder.
2. **Secondary Search Location**: If the view is not found in the controller-specific folder, it looks for the view in the `Shared` folder.

### Example

- The `ProductsController` has an action method called `All`. When this action returns a view, MVC first looks for `All.cshtml` in the `Products` folder inside `Views`. If it doesn't find the view there, it looks in the `Shared` folder.

The same behavior applies to the `HomeController`. If you add an action method in `HomeController` that also returns the `All` view, it will first search in the `Home` folder and then in the `Shared` folder if the view is not found.

```csharp
// All.cshtml
<h2>All Products</h2>
<p>This is shared content for both the HomeController and ProductsController.</p>
```

## What Happens If the View Exists in Both Locations?

If the same view exists in both the controller-specific folder (e.g., `Views/Home`) and the `Shared` folder, the view in the controller-specific folder will take precedence, and the view in the `Shared` folder will be ignored.

## Real-World Usage

In real-world applications, shared views are useful when you want to show the same content across different controllers and action methods. They are commonly used for layout views and partial views.
