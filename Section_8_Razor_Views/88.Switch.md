# Razor Switch Case in ASP.NET Core MVC

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `switch` case in Razor views within an ASP.NET Core MVC application.

## Overview

In C#, the `switch` case allows us to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable. The same concept applies to Razor views, but instead of executing only C# code, you can print specific HTML content depending on the switch case.

### Example Scenario

In this example, we have a `Person` object with a `Gender` property. Based on the value of `Gender`, the view prints different content, such as a message corresponding to various international days.

### Razor View Code

Here is an example Razor view using a `switch` case to conditionally render HTML content based on the `Gender` of the `Person` object:

```razor
@using ViewsExample.Models
@{
    string appTitle = "Asp.Net Core Demo App";
    Person person = new Person() { Name = "John", DateOfBirth = null, PersonGender = Gender.Female };
}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>@appTitle</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <h2>Hello @person.Name</h2>

    @if (person.DateOfBirth.HasValue)
    {
        double age = Math.Round((DateTime.Now - person.DateOfBirth.Value).TotalDays / 365.25);
        <h3>@age years old</h3>
    }
    else
    {
        <h3>Date of birth is unknown</h3>
    }

    @switch (person.PersonGender)
    {
        case Gender.Male:
            <p>November 19 is International Men's Day</p>
            break;

        case Gender.Female:
            <p>March 8 is International Women's Day</p>
            break;

        case Gender.Other:
            <p>March 31 is International Transgender Day</p>
            break;

        default:
            <p>Gender not specified.</p>
            break;
    }
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation

- **Switch Case**: The switch case is applied to the `PersonGender` property of the `Person` object. Depending on whether the gender is `Male`, `Female`, or `Other`, a different message is displayed.
- **Default Case**: If the gender does not match any of the specified cases, a default message is displayed indicating that gender is not specified.

This example demonstrates how you can implement a switch case in Razor views to render different content based on specific conditions.

This approach allows for clean and organized rendering of content based on various conditions in Razor views.
