# Asp.Net Core Razor Views - Local Functions

This lesson focuses on how to implement and use local functions within Razor views in an Asp.Net Core application.

## Local Functions in Razor Views

Local functions are a powerful feature in C# that allow you to create reusable code within a specific method or view. Razor views also support local functions, enabling you to define small reusable code blocks that can be used within the same view.

### Benefits of Local Functions:

- **Reusability**: Local functions are accessible only within the view where they are defined, making them ideal for small, repetitive tasks.
- **Encapsulation**: The logic is encapsulated within the view, so it doesn't interfere with other parts of the application.

### Example:

In this example, we define a local function that calculates the age of a person based on their date of birth:

```csharp
@using ViewsExample.Models
@{
    List<Person> people = new List<Person>()
    {
        new Person() { Name = "John", DateOfBirth = DateTime.Parse("2000-05-06"), PersonGender = Gender.Male},
        new Person() { Name = "Linda", DateOfBirth = DateTime.Parse("2005-01-09"), PersonGender = Gender.Female},
        new Person() { Name = "Susan", DateOfBirth = DateTime.Parse("2008-07-12"), PersonGender = Gender.Other}
    };
}

@functions {
    double? GetAge(DateTime? dateOfBirth)
    {
        if (dateOfBirth == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        return Math.Round((DateTime.Now - dateOfBirth.Value).TotalDays / 365);
    }
}

@foreach (var person in people)
{
    <p>@person.Name is @GetAge(person.DateOfBirth) years old.</p>
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Local Function Definition**: 
   - The local function `GetAge` is defined within the `@functions` block. It takes a nullable `DateTime` parameter and calculates the person's age by subtracting their birthdate from the current date.

2. **Usage**: 
   - The local function is then called inside the `@foreach` loop to calculate and display the age for each person in the list.

### Key Points:

- **Scope**: Local functions are limited in scope to the view in which they are declared. They cannot be accessed from other views or controllers.
- **Performance**: Since local functions are defined and used within the same view, they can help reduce redundant code and improve performance in scenarios where similar logic needs to be repeated.
