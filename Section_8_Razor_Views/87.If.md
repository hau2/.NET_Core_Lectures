# Conditional Rendering in Razor Views

This tutorial demonstrates how to render content conditionally in Razor views within an ASP.NET Core MVC application.

## Overview

Sometimes in web applications, you may want to display certain content conditionally based on a specific condition. For example, if a user is logged in, you might want to display a "Logout" button. If not, the button should not be shown. In Razor views, this is done using conditional logic, much like in C#.

### Example Scenario

In this example, we consider a scenario where we want to display a person's age only if their Date of Birth (`DateOfBirth`) is not `null`. If it is `null`, we want to display a message stating that the date of birth is unknown.

### Razor View Code

Here is the Razor code to conditionally render content:

```razor
@using ViewsExample.Models
@{
    string appTitle = "Asp.Net Core Demo App";
    Person person = new Person() { Name = "John", DateOfBirth = null };
}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>@appTitle</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <h2>Hello @person.Name</h2>
        @if (person.DateOfBirth.HasValue)
        {
            double age = Math.Round((DateTime.Now - person.DateOfBirth.Value).TotalDays / 365.25);
            <h3>@age years old</h3>
        }
        else
        {
            <h3>Date of birth is unknown</h3>
        }
    </body>
</html>
```

### Explanation

- **App Title**: The page title is set to `"Asp.Net Core Demo App"`.
- **Person Object**: We create a `Person` object with a `Name` ("John") and a `DateOfBirth` which is `null`.
- **Conditional Rendering**: 
  - If the `DateOfBirth` is not `null`, the view calculates the person's age and displays it.
  - If the `DateOfBirth` is `null`, the view displays "Date of birth is unknown."

This is a basic example of how you can use Razor's `@if` statement to perform conditional logic within a view.

### Other Conditional Logic

You can also implement more complex logic using `else if`, `else`, and nested if statements in your Razor views. For example:

```razor
@if (someCondition)
{
    // Do something
}
else if (otherCondition)
{
    // Do something else
}
else
{
    // Default action
}
```

### Real-World Use Case

A real-world example might involve conditionally showing content on a search results page. For instance, only show the results section if there are results to display:

```razor
@if (Model.Results.Any())
{
    <div>
        <!-- Display search results here -->
    </div>
}
```
