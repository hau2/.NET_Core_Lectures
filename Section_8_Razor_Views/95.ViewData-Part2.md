# ViewData - Part 2 Detailed Summary

## Overview
This part of the lesson delves into the continued use of `ViewData` for passing data from the controller to the view. It also introduces custom CSS implementation for better presentation in the view. Additionally, it discusses best practices related to static files and the use of custom styles over popular frameworks like Bootstrap.

## Key Concepts

- **ViewData Usage**: Similar to Part 1, `ViewData` continues to be a primary method for transferring data between the controller and view. Data is added to `ViewData` in the controller and then accessed in the view using the same key.

- **CSS Integration**: The lesson emphasizes the importance of custom CSS for enhancing the visual appeal of a page. The CSS files are stored in the `wwwroot` folder, and styles are linked into the view using the `link` tag.

- **Static Files in ASP.NET Core**: Static files like CSS and JavaScript are stored in the `wwwroot` folder and are treated as static content. The lesson demonstrates how to properly enable static files and import them into your project.

- **Avoiding Bootstrap**: The lesson advises against using Bootstrap for real-world projects because it tends to make all applications look similar. Instead, it suggests using custom CSS for a unique look and feel.

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example 1: Adding a Custom CSS File

In the controller:
```csharp
// Ensure that static files are enabled in Program.cs
// Import the custom stylesheet in the view
<link rel="stylesheet" href="~/stylesheet.css" />
```

### Example 2: Using Custom CSS Classes

In the view:
```html
<!-- Applying custom styles to HTML elements -->
<div class="page-content">
    <!-- Page content here -->
</div>
<div class="box">
    <h3>@person.Name</h3>
    <table class="table w-100">
        <tr>
            <td>Gender:</td>
            <td>@person.Gender</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Date of Birth:</td>
            <td>@person.DateOfBirth.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy")</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
```

### Example 3: Float and Width CSS Classes

In the custom stylesheet:
```css
/* Custom CSS */
.page-content {
    padding: 20px;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

.box {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

.table {
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 10px;
}

/* Width classes */
.w-50 { width: 50%; }
.w-75 { width: 75%; }
.w-100 { width: 100%; }
```

### Example 4: Static File Management

In the Program.cs:
```csharp
// Ensure that static files are enabled
app.UseStaticFiles();
```

## Conclusion
This section reinforces the importance of custom styling in ASP.NET Core applications. It shows how to integrate custom CSS into the project and apply styles for a cleaner, more polished look. The lesson also continues to use `ViewData` for data transfer between the controller and the view.
