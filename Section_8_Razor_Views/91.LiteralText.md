# Asp.Net Core Razor Views - Handling Literal Text

This lesson demonstrates how to handle static or literal text within Razor views in an Asp.Net Core application.

## Handling Literal Text in Razor

In Razor, you might encounter situations where you want to output some static text alongside your dynamic code. If this static text is placed inside a Razor block, Razor may interpret it as C# code, leading to errors.

### Solution:

Razor provides multiple ways to handle such situations:

1. **Using `@:` (at-colon)**
   - Prefixing a line with `@:` will inform Razor that the entire line should be treated as plain static text instead of C# code.
   
   Example:
   ```csharp
   @:Hello, this is a static text message!
   ```

2. **Using `<text>` Tag**
   - You can use the `<text>` tag to treat a specific portion of the content as static text, ensuring that Razor will output it as-is.

   Example:
   ```html
   <text>This portion is literal text inside a Razor block.</text>
   ```

3. **Using HTML Tags**
   - Wrapping static text within standard HTML tags like `<span>`, `<div>`, etc., will naturally ensure Razor treats it as HTML, preventing Razor from attempting to parse it as C# code.

   Example:
   ```html
   <span>This is static text inside a span tag.</span>
   ```

### Example Razor View:

In this example, a simple message is printed along with dynamic content using the above techniques to handle literal text:

```csharp
@using ViewsExample.Models
@{
    string message = "Hello, welcome to the Razor views tutorial!";
}

<p>@:This is a literal text message using @:.</p>
<p><text>This message is wrapped in a <text> tag.</text></p>
<p>This is a dynamic message: @message</p>
```

### Commenting in Razor

- To comment in Razor, use the `@*...*@` syntax for block comments.
  
  Example:
  ```csharp
  @* This is a comment in Razor *@
  ```

### Key Points:

- Razor provides several ways to handle literal text, ensuring your static content is output correctly without being misinterpreted as C# code.
- Use the `@:` operator, `<text>` tag, or regular HTML tags as needed to manage static content.
