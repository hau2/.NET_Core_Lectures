# Code Blocks and Expressions in ASP.NET Core Razor Views

## Introduction
In ASP.NET Core, Razor views allow you to embed server-side C# code within HTML to create dynamic web pages. This is accomplished using Razor code blocks and expressions. Razor code blocks are used to declare variables, initialize them, and write C# logic directly in the view. Razor expressions are used to output the values of these variables or any other server-side expression within the HTML.

Razor's power lies in its ability to mix C# and HTML, giving you the flexibility to create complex, dynamic web applications without leaving the view layer. Understanding how and when to use Razor code blocks and expressions is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable ASP.NET Core applications.

## Razor Code Blocks
Razor code blocks are enclosed within `@{ }`. Inside these blocks, you can write any valid C# code, including variable declarations, conditionals, loops, and more. The code written inside a Razor code block is executed on the server before the response is sent to the client.

### Example: Declaring Variables
In a Razor code block, you can declare and initialize variables. These variables can then be used throughout the view.

```csharp
@{
    var appTitle = "My Application";
    var yearEstablished = 2024;
}
```

In this example, we are declaring two variables, `appTitle` and `yearEstablished`, which can be used elsewhere in the view.

### Complex Logic in Razor Code Blocks
You can also include more complex logic, such as loops and conditionals, within Razor code blocks.

```csharp
@{
    var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
}
<ul>
    @foreach (var number in numbers)
    {
        <li>@number</li>
    }
</ul>
```

In this example, we create a list of numbers and use a `foreach` loop to iterate over the list, printing each number as a list item in the HTML.

## Razor Expressions
Razor expressions are used to render server-side values directly into the HTML. These expressions are prefixed with `@` followed by the variable or method that you want to render.

### Example: Rendering a Variable
```html
<h1>Welcome to @appTitle</h1>
```

In this case, the value of `appTitle` is inserted into the `<h1>` tag. When the page is rendered, this Razor expression will be replaced by the value of `appTitle` on the server, and the client will see the output as plain HTML.

### Complex Expressions
Razor expressions can also handle more complex logic inline. For example, you can calculate values or call methods:

```html
<h2>The current year is @DateTime.Now.Year</h2>
```

Here, `@DateTime.Now.Year` will output the current year dynamically.

## Example: Creating Dynamic Views with Razor
Let’s go through a complete example of how to use Razor code blocks and expressions to create a dynamic web page. In this example, we will display a list of products with their prices and a discount applied based on certain conditions.

### Step 1: Define the Model
First, we need to create a model class that holds the data for our products. This might be defined in a `Product` class.

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Model in the View
Next, we initialize a list of products in a Razor code block at the top of the view.

```csharp
@{
    var products = new List<Product>
    {
        new Product { Name = "Laptop", Price = 1200 },
        new Product { Name = "Smartphone", Price = 800 },
        new Product { Name = "Tablet", Price = 450 }
    };

    var discountRate = 0.10m; // 10% discount
}
```

### Step 3: Render the Data in HTML
Now, we use Razor expressions and loops to display the product data dynamically in the view.

```html
<h1>Product List</h1>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Product</th>
        <th>Original Price</th>
        <th>Discounted Price</th>
    </tr>
    @foreach (var product in products)
    {
        var discountedPrice = product.Price - (product.Price * discountRate);
        <tr>
            <td>@product.Name</td>
            <td>@product.Price</td>
            <td>@discountedPrice</td>
        </tr>
    }
</table>
```

### Output
This code will render a table of products, showing their original price and the price after applying a 10% discount. All the calculations are performed server-side using Razor, and only the final HTML is sent to the browser.

### Handling Conditions
Razor code blocks can also handle conditions, allowing you to dynamically alter the content based on logic.

```html
@if (products.Count > 0)
{
    <p>There are @products.Count products available.</p>
}
else
{
    <p>No products available.</p>
}
```

This block checks if there are any products in the list and displays an appropriate message based on that condition.

## Razor View Engine
Razor is the view engine that defines the syntax and structure for embedding C# code in ASP.NET Core views. It allows you to intermix server-side logic with HTML efficiently. Razor views end in `.cshtml`, indicating that they contain both C# and HTML.

### Server-Side vs. Client-Side Execution
- **Server-Side**: All the Razor code is executed on the server. This means that any logic or calculation you write in a Razor code block or expression is completed before the page is sent to the browser.
- **Client-Side**: The browser only receives the resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. None of the Razor code is sent to the client.

## Recommendations for Best Practices
1. **Keep Razor Logic Simple**: While Razor allows you to write complex C# logic in views, it’s recommended to keep the view as simple as possible. The controller should handle most of the logic, and the view should focus on rendering the UI.
2. **Use ViewModels**: Pass data to the view through ViewModels, which are tailored to the specific needs of the view. This helps keep the views clean and focused on presentation rather than processing.
3. **Minimize Code in Views**: Avoid writing extensive C# code directly in the view. If you find yourself writing more than a few lines of code, consider moving the logic to a controller or a helper class.

## Conclusion
Razor views provide a powerful way to mix C# and HTML to create dynamic and interactive web pages. By leveraging Razor code blocks and expressions, developers can render data, apply logic, and create highly customized views in ASP.NET Core applications. The separation of server-side and client-side code in Razor ensures that the server handles all the heavy lifting before sending a clean and efficient response to the client.
