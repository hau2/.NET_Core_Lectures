# _ViewImports.cshtml Summary

## Overview
The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is used to define common directives and namespaces that are shared across multiple views within an ASP.NET Core MVC application. By importing common namespaces or directives in this file, you avoid repeating them in each individual view.

## Key Concepts

- **Purpose of _ViewImports.cshtml**: The primary function of this file is to import common namespaces and directives used by multiple views. For example, instead of importing a model's namespace in each view, you can import it once in `_ViewImports.cshtml`, and it will be available for all views within the same folder.

- **Global vs Local _ViewImports.cshtml**: You can place `_ViewImports.cshtml` at different levels of your views' folder structure. When placed at the root level, it acts as a global import for all views across the application. When placed in a specific folder (e.g., `Home` or `Products`), it only applies to views within that folder.

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example 1: Creating a _ViewImports.cshtml File

In the home folder:
```csharp
@using ProjectName.Models
```

This imports the `Models` namespace from the project, making it available to all views in the `Home` folder.

### Example 2: Global and Local Imports

- **Global Import**: Placing `_ViewImports.cshtml` in the root of the `Views` folder makes its directives available to all views in the application.
- **Local Import**: Placing `_ViewImports.cshtml` in a specific folder like `Home` or `Products` restricts its imports to only views within that folder.

For example, in the global `_ViewImports.cshtml`:
```csharp
@using System.Collections
```
This import is available to all views across the application.

In the local `_ViewImports.cshtml`:
```csharp
@using ProjectName.Models
```
This import is only available to views within the specific folder, such as `Home` or `Products`.

### Example 3: Accessing Imported Namespaces

In a view within the `Home` folder:
```csharp
@model Person
<h1>@Model.Name</h1>
```
Since the `Person` class is in the `Models` namespace, and that namespace is imported globally or locally through `_ViewImports.cshtml`, you don't need to manually add the `@using ProjectName.Models` directive in each view.

## Advantages of Using _ViewImports.cshtml

- **Avoid Redundancy**: Reduces repetition of common `@using` directives across multiple views, making code more maintainable and less error-prone.
- **Improved Organization**: Provides a clean and centralized way to manage commonly used namespaces and directives.
- **Flexibility**: You can apply different imports to specific folders or apply global imports to the entire application.

## Conclusion
The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is an essential tool for simplifying code management in ASP.NET Core MVC applications. It helps reduce redundancy and provides flexibility for managing common directives and namespaces across different views. Depending on where the file is placed, it can apply globally or locally to specific views.
