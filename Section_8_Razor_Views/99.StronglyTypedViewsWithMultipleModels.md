# Strongly Typed Views - Multiple Models Summary

## Overview
In this lesson, we explore the use of **Strongly Typed Views** to handle multiple models in a single view. While ASP.NET Core strongly typed views are typically bound to a single model, it is possible to access data from multiple models by using a **wrapper model**.

## Key Concepts

- **Single Model Limitation**: A strongly typed view is designed to work with one model at a time, making it impossible to directly bind two or more models to a view.
  
- **Wrapper Model (ViewModel)**: The solution to handling multiple models is to create a wrapper class that contains properties from both models. This wrapper model is then passed to the view, allowing the view to access the data of both models.

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Wrapper Model for Multiple Models

The wrapper model contains properties from two different models, such as `Person` and `Product`:
```csharp
public class PersonProductWrapper
{
    public Person PersonData { get; set; }
    public Product ProductData { get; set; }
}
```

### Example 2: Controller Action Method for Wrapping Multiple Models

In the controller, create objects for both `Person` and `Product`, and then populate the wrapper model:
```csharp
public IActionResult PersonWithProduct()
{
    var person = new Person { Name = "John", Gender = "Male" };
    var product = new Product { ProductId = 101, ProductName = "Laptop" };

    var wrapper = new PersonProductWrapper
    {
        PersonData = person,
        ProductData = product
    };

    return View(wrapper);
}
```

### Example 3: Strongly Typed View for Accessing Multiple Models

In the view, you can access the properties of both `Person` and `Product` through the wrapper model:
```csharp
@model PersonProductWrapper

<div>
    <h1>Person Details</h1>
    <p>Name: @Model.PersonData.Name</p>
    <p>Gender: @Model.PersonData.Gender</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Product Details</h1>
    <p>Product ID: @Model.ProductData.ProductId</p>
    <p>Product Name: @Model.ProductData.ProductName</p>
</div>
```

### Example 4: Generating Links in the Index View

In the index view, you can create a dynamic link that leads to the view handling both `Person` and `Product` data:
```html
<a href="/person-with-product">Person with Product</a>
```

## Advantages of Using a Wrapper Model

- **Flexibility**: Allows the view to access and display data from multiple models.
- **Type Safety**: The use of a wrapper model maintains the benefits of strong typing, including IntelliSense support and compile-time checking.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The wrapper model keeps the logic for combining different models out of the view, maintaining cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Conclusion
The use of wrapper models is an effective solution for handling multiple models in a single view. This approach allows you to maintain the strong typing of views while providing flexibility to display data from more than one model at the same time.
