# Strongly Typed Views - Part 1 Summary

## Overview
The concept of **Strongly Typed Views** is introduced to tightly bind a view with a specific model class, making it easier to access model objects or model collections within the view. This approach eliminates the need to pass data through `ViewData` or `ViewBag`.

## Key Concepts

- **Strongly Typed View**: A view that is tightly coupled with a specific model class. You declare this relationship using the `@model` directive at the top of the view.
  
- **Model Directive**: The `@model` directive is used at the top of the view to specify the data type (model class) that the view will bind to. For example, if a view is meant to display a list of persons, you would use:
  ```csharp
  @model List<Person>
  ```

- **Model Property**: The `Model` property is a predefined property in the view that contains the model object supplied by the controller. This model can be a single object or a collection, depending on what the controller passes.

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example 1: Declaring a Strongly Typed View

In the view:
```csharp
@model List<Person>

@foreach (var person in Model)
{
    <p>@person.Name</p>
}
```

### Example 2: Supplying the Model from the Controller

In the controller:
```csharp
public IActionResult Index()
{
    List<Person> people = new List<Person>
    {
        new Person { Name = "John Doe", Age = 30 },
        new Person { Name = "Jane Doe", Age = 25 }
    };
    return View(people); // Passing the model to the view
}
```

### Example 3: Accessing Model Data in the View

In the view, the model data is automatically assigned to the `Model` property, allowing you to access it directly:
```csharp
@model List<Person>

@foreach (var person in Model)
{
    <p>@person.Name, Age: @person.Age</p>
}
```

## Advantages of Strongly Typed Views

- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed views ensure that you are working with a specific model type, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- **Cleaner Code**: By binding the view directly to a model class, you eliminate the need for `ViewBag` or `ViewData` and avoid typecasting.
- **Intellisense Support**: With strongly typed views, you get full IntelliSense support in your IDE, helping you write code faster and with fewer mistakes.

## Conclusion
Strongly typed views are a powerful feature in ASP.NET that help you create more maintainable and type-safe views by tightly coupling them with model classes. By using the `@model` directive, you gain access to a model's properties directly within the view, resulting in cleaner and more efficient code.
