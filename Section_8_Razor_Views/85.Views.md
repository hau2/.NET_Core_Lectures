# Views in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction
In ASP.NET Core, the view is a web page responsible for display and presentation logic. The presentation logic can be in the form of HTML (client-side code) or C# (server-side code). This means that the C# code is executed on the server first, then the resulting HTML is sent to the browser, and finally the HTML is executed in the browser.

## Role of the View
- The view is called by the Controller.
- The Controller will create and send a ViewModel object to the view.
- The view uses the ViewModel object to access the necessary data and display it to the user.

For example, the Controller might create an Employee ViewModel object containing details such as employee ID, name, work awards, and other details. This data is then displayed through the view.

## View Operation Process
1. **Controller Creates ViewModel**: The controller is responsible for creating a ViewModel object or a collection of objects. These objects will contain all the necessary data to be displayed to the user interface.
2. **Choosing the Appropriate View**: Based on the route information or user request, the Controller determines which view should be executed. For instance, a route may have a value like `summary` or `detailed`, and depending on that value, the appropriate view is selected.
3. **Passing Data to the View**: The Controller passes the ViewModel object to the view. The view then accesses the properties of the ViewModel and displays the data accordingly.
4. **Returning HTML**: The final result of the view is an HTML page containing data from the ViewModel, and this HTML page is returned as a response to the browser.

## Creating Views in ASP.NET Core
When creating a view in ASP.NET Core, the process involves the following steps:

1. **Create a New Project**: Start by creating a new ASP.NET Core project.
2. **Add Controllers and Views**: Ensure that the services for Controllers and Views are added to the program.
3. **Folder Structure**: Create the necessary folders such as `wwwroot` for static content, `Controllers` for the controllers, and `Views` for the view pages.
4. **Create a Controller**: For example, create a `HomeController` with a default action method called `Index`.

### Defining the View Location
Views in ASP.NET Core are generally found in the following default locations:

- **Default Location**: Views are located in `Views/ControllerName/ActionName.cshtml`. For example, if the controller is `HomeController` and the action method is `Index`, the view will be located at `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`.
- **Shared Views**: Views that are shared between multiple controllers can be placed in the `Shared` folder.

### Example Code
If `HomeController` has an action method `Index`, the following code will return the view:

```csharp
public IActionResult Index()
{
    return View();
}
```

- This code creates an object of the `ViewResult` class.
- By default, ASP.NET Core will look for a view named `Index.cshtml` in the `Views/Home/` directory.

### Razor Views and HTML
- A view file is an HTML page that can contain both HTML and C# code. Razor views allow combining C# and HTML within the same file.
- The C# code is executed on the server, while the HTML code is executed in the browser.

Example of a Razor view with both HTML and C# code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to ASP.NET Core</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the application</h1>
    <p>@DateTime.Now</p> <!-- This is a piece of C# code executed on the server -->
</body>
</html>
```

- The line `@DateTime.Now` is C# code and will display the current server time.

## Execution Process of the View
Here is an example of the execution process when a view is returned:

1. **Request URL**: The user requests a specific URL, such as `Home/Index`.
2. **Controller Processing**: The `Index` action method in `HomeController` is triggered.
3. **ViewModel Creation**: The controller creates a ViewModel containing the data.
4. **Calling the View**: The controller returns the view by calling `return View()`, and the result is HTML.
5. **Browser Display**: The browser receives the HTML and displays the content to the user.

## Conclusion
Views in ASP.NET Core help to separate server-side C# code from client-side HTML code. This ensures that all data processing is done on the server, and only the processed data is sent to the browser in the form of HTML. ASP.NET Core also provides strong support for combining C# and HTML through Razor views.
