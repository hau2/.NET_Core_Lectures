# MVC Architecture Pattern Summary

## Introduction
In most ASP.NET Core applications, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern is used to separate the code into models, views, and controllers.

## MVC Components

1. **Model**: Handles the business logic and data-related tasks. There are two types of models:
   - **Business Model**: Performs business operations, such as database CRUD actions and validations.
   - **View Model**: Prepares data to be displayed on the UI.

2. **View**: Contains the presentation logic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). It does not directly interact with the business model but uses data from the ViewModel provided by the Controller.

3. **Controller**: Receives user input and processes it. It:
   - Routes requests to appropriate actions.
   - Invokes business models to execute business logic.
   - Passes the ViewModel to the View for rendering.

## MVC Workflow

1. **Request Handling**: The request is received and routed to the appropriate Controller action method.
2. **Model Binding**: The Controller binds the request data (e.g., form inputs) to the Model.
3. **Business Logic Execution**: The Controller calls the Business Model to execute business logic and retrieves necessary data from the database.
4. **ViewModel Creation**: The Controller prepares a ViewModel containing the data to be displayed in the View.
5. **Rendering the View**: The ViewModel is passed to the View, which renders the HTML page.
6. **Response**: The View generates the final HTML page, which is sent back to the client (browser).

## Example Scenario: Login Page in E-commerce Application

- The user enters an email and password.
- The request is routed to the Controller.
- The Controller binds the form data to the Model and validates the data.
- The Business Model verifies the credentials against the database.
- If the credentials are valid, a ViewModel containing product data is created.
- The View renders the products page using the ViewModel and sends the HTML response back to the browser.

## Benefits of MVC Pattern
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC separates business logic, UI logic, and control flow, making it easier to manage large applications.
- **Independent Development**: Different teams can work on models, views, and controllers in parallel.
- **Unit Testing**: Each component can be independently unit tested.
- **Reusability**: The modular design allows for easier reuse of components.
