# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** is an architectural pattern that divides the application into three components: **Models**, **Views**, and **Controllers**.

## Responsibilities of MVC Components

### Controller
- Receives HTTP request data.
- Invokes the business model to execute business logic.
- Creates an object of ViewModel and fills data into its properties.
- Selects a view, invokes it, and passes the ViewModel object to the view.

### Business Model
- Receives input from the controller.
- Performs operations such as retrieving or inserting data into a database.
- Sends the data back to the controller.

### View
- Receives the ViewModel object from the controller.
- Accesses ViewModel properties to render data in HTML.
- After rendering, the view sends the response back.

### Benefits of MVC
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component is responsible for a single task, making error detection and fixing easier.
- **Independent Development**: Each component can be developed independently. Models are independent of both views and controllers.
- **Unit Testing**: The separation allows easy testing of each component.

## Views and Razor View Engine

### Razor View Engine
The Razor View Engine is responsible for defining the syntax used to write C# code within views. Below are some key features:

- **Razor Code Block**:
    ```csharp
    @{
        // C# code or HTML goes here
    }
    ```

- **Razor Expressions**:
    ```csharp
    @Expression
    @(Expression)
    ```

- **Razor If Statement**:
    ```csharp
    @if (condition) {
        // C# code or HTML goes here
    }
    ```

- **Razor Switch Statement**:
    ```csharp
    @switch (variable) {
        case value1:
            // C# or HTML goes here;
            break;
        case value2:
            // C# or HTML goes here;
            break;
        default:
            // Default C# or HTML;
    }
    ```

- **Loops**:
  - **foreach Loop**:
    ```csharp
    @foreach (var item in collection) {
        // C# or HTML goes here
    }
    ```
  - **for Loop**:
    ```csharp
    @for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
        // C# or HTML goes here
    }
    ```

## ViewData and ViewBag

### ViewData
ViewData is a dictionary object used to pass data from the controller to the view. Properties include:
- `int Count`: Gets the number of elements.
- `void Add(string key, object value)`: Adds a new element.

### ViewBag
ViewBag is similar to ViewData but easier to use because it's dynamic. Example:
- `ViewBag.property` versus `ViewData["key"]`

## Strongly Typed Views
Strongly Typed Views are bound to a specific model class. Benefits include:
- **IntelliSense support**: Helps identify model properties.
- **Compile-time checking**: Ensures error detection for non-existing properties.

## Helper Methods for Controllers to Invoke Views
- `return View();`
- `return View(object model);`
- `return View(string viewName, object model);`

## Shared Views and ViewImports.cshtml
Shared views are stored in the "Shared" folder and are accessible from any controller. The **ViewImports.cshtml** file is used to import common namespaces for views.
