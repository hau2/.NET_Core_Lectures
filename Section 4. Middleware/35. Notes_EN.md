# Middleware Notes in ASP.NET Core

## Overview of Middleware

Middleware in ASP.NET Core consists of components forming a pipeline for HTTP requests and responses. Each component can:
- Examine the incoming request.
- Modify the request or response.
- Invoke the next middleware in the pipeline or terminate the process and generate a response itself.

### Middleware Chain (Request Pipeline)

Imagine the request pipeline as a series of connected pipes, where each piece of middleware acts as a valve to control the flow of information and apply specific operations at different stages. The order in which you register your middleware is crucial, as they execute sequentially.

## app.Use vs. app.Run

Both `app.Use` and `app.Run` are fundamental for adding middleware to your pipeline, with key differences:

- **app.Use(async (context, next) => { ... })**
  - **Non-Terminal Middleware**: Performs actions and calls the next delegate to pass control to the next middleware.
  - **Can Modify Request/Response**: Able to change the request or response before passing it along.
  - **Examples**: Authentication, logging, custom headers.

- **app.Run(async (context) => { ... })**
  - **Terminal Middleware**: Ends the pipeline and generates the response itself.
  - **Often Used for Final Response**: Handles requests that don't need further processing.

## Code Example 1: Multiple app.Run Calls

```csharp
app.Run(async (HttpContext context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello");
});
 
app.Run(async (HttpContext context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello again");
});
 
app.Run();
```

In this code, only the first `app.Run` middleware will be executed, as it terminates the pipeline by writing "Hello" to the response.

## Code Example 2: Chaining Middleware with app.Use and app.Run

```csharp
// Middleware 1
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello ");
    await next(context); 
});
 
// Middleware 2
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello again ");
    await next(context);
});
 
// Middleware 3
app.Run(async (HttpContext context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello again");
});
```

This code demonstrates chaining middleware correctly. The result is "Hello Hello again Hello again".

## Custom Middleware in ASP.NET Core

While ASP.NET Core provides many built-in middleware components, you may need to create your own to address specific requirements. Custom middleware allows you to:
- **Encapsulate Logic**: Bundle operations like logging or security checks.
- **Customize Behavior**: Tailor the pipeline to match your application's needs.
- **Improve Code Organization**: Keep middleware code clean and maintainable.

### Anatomy of a Custom Middleware Class

Implementing custom middleware typically involves:
- **Implement IMiddleware**: This interface requires the `InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)` method.
- **InvokeAsync or Invoke Method**:
  - **context**: Provides access to the request and response objects.
  - **next**: Allows calling the next middleware in the pipeline.

### Code Explanation: MyCustomMiddleware

```csharp
// MyCustomMiddleware.cs
namespace MiddlewareExample.CustomMiddleware
{
    public class MyCustomMiddleware : IMiddleware  
    {
        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("My Custom Middleware - Starts
");
            await next(context);  
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("My Custom Middleware - Ends
");
        }
    }
 
    // Extension method for easy registration
    public static class CustomMiddlewareExtension
    {
        public static IApplicationBuilder UseMyCustomMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            return app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();
        }
    }
}
```

### How It Works

- **Registration**: Register `MyCustomMiddleware` as a transient service for ASP.NET Core to create instances as needed.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Use `app.UseMyCustomMiddleware()` to seamlessly add middleware to the pipeline.
- **Execution Order**: Middleware components execute in the order added to the pipeline.

## UseWhen in ASP.NET Core

`UseWhen()` is a powerful extension method in ASP.NET Core's `IApplicationBuilder` interface. It allows conditional middleware execution based on a predicate (a condition).

### Syntax

```csharp
app.UseWhen(
    context => /* Your condition here */,
    app => /* Middleware configuration for the branch */
);
```

- **context**: The `HttpContext` object representing the current request.
- **Predicate (Condition)**: A function returning true if the middleware branch should execute.
- **Middleware Configuration**: Configures middleware components for execution if the condition is true.

### Code Example: UseWhen Explained

```csharp
app.UseWhen(
    context => context.Request.Query.ContainsKey("username"), 
    app => {
        app.Use(async (context, next) =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from Middleware branch");
            await next(); 
        });
    });
 
app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from middleware at main chain");
});
```

**Output:**
- If the request contains the "username" query parameter, the output will be:
  ```
  Hello from Middleware branch
  Hello from middleware at main chain
  ```
- If not, the output will be:
  ```
  Hello from middleware at main chain
  ```

### When to Use UseWhen

- **Conditional Features**: Enable features based on the request (e.g., logging for certain users).
- **Dynamic Pipelines**: Create pipelines that adapt to different requests.
- **A/B Testing**: Route users through alternative middleware branches for experimentation.
- **Debugging and Diagnostics**: Apply diagnostic middleware only in development environments.

## Key Points to Remember

- **Middleware Order is Crucial**: Middleware executes in the order it's registered.
- **app.Use vs. app.Run**:
  - **app.Use**: For non-terminal actions, calls next to pass control.
  - **app.Run**: For terminal actions, ends the pipeline.
- **UseWhen**: Conditionally adds middleware branches based on request criteria.
- **Custom Middleware**: Encapsulates logic and improves code organization.
