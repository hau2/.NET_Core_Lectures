## Overview

The `UseWhen` method in ASP.NET Core allows for conditional middleware execution. This technique is useful when you need certain middleware logic to run only under specific conditions, thus optimizing the request handling process.

## Key Concepts

1. **Middleware**: Software components that handle requests and responses in an ASP.NET Core application.
2. **UseWhen Method**: Conditionally executes middleware based on a predicate function.
3. **Request Pipeline**: The sequence of middleware that processes an HTTP request.

## Program.cs Explanation

This file illustrates how to use `UseWhen` to execute middleware based on specific request conditions.

### Program.cs

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseWhen(
    context => context.Request.Query.ContainsKey("username"),
    app => {
        app.Use(async (context, next) =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from Middleware branch");
            await next();
        });
    });

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from middleware at main chain");
});

app.Run();
```

**Explanation:**

- **UseWhen Method**: 
  - The `UseWhen` method allows you to execute middleware conditionally. It takes a predicate function that determines when the middleware branch should be executed.
  - In this example, the predicate checks if the query string contains a key named "username".

- **Conditional Middleware Branch**:
  - Executes only when the condition is true.
  - Writes "Hello from Middleware branch" to the response and continues to the next middleware.

- **Main Middleware Chain**:
  - Always executes, writing "Hello from middleware at main chain" to the response.

## How It Works

1. **Condition Check**: The `UseWhen` method evaluates whether the query string contains the "username" parameter.
2. **Branch Execution**: If the condition is met, the specified middleware branch executes.
3. **Continuation**: After the branch executes (or if the condition is not met), the main middleware continues processing the request.

## Real-World Applications

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Conditionally apply authentication logic based on request headers or query parameters.
- **Logging**: Log additional information for requests meeting specific criteria.
- **Feature Toggles**: Enable or disable features dynamically based on request data.

## Conclusion

Using `UseWhen`, you can enhance the flexibility and efficiency of your ASP.NET Core applications by applying conditional logic in the middleware pipeline. This approach helps optimize resource usage and ensures that only relevant middleware is executed for specific requests.
