# Introduction to Middleware

Middleware is a component that is assembled into the application pipeline to handle requests and responses.

## Understanding Middleware

- Middleware consists of a set of methods that execute one after another whenever a request is received.
- These methods are called middleware.
- Upon receiving a request:
  1. The first middleware executes.
  2. The second middleware executes.
  3. This sequence continues for all middleware components.

After all middlewares execute, a response is sent back to the browser.

## Middleware Chain

- Middlewares are chained and execute in the sequence they are added.
- The application request pipeline starts empty, and middleware components are added one by one.
- Each middleware performs a single operation, following the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Example

- **First Middleware**: Implements HTTPS redirection.
- **Second Middleware**: Enables static files redirection.
- **Third Middleware**: Enables authentication.
- **Fourth Middleware**: Enables authorization.

Each middleware performs an individual operation, allowing easy understanding and composition of the sequence.

## Flexibility of Middleware

- If a particular operation is not needed, the corresponding middleware can be removed without affecting others.
- This flexibility is a key benefit of using middleware.

## Creating Middleware

Middleware can be created in two ways:
1. **Request Delegate**: Using an anonymous method or lambda expression, suitable for simple operations.
2. **Middleware Class**: For larger functionality, code can be written in a separate middleware class.

## Middleware Behavior

- Not every middleware must forward the request to the next middleware.
- Middleware that does not forward the request is termed as terminal middleware or short-circuiting middleware.

Further lectures will explore the development of middleware's execution.
