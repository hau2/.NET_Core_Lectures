## Introduction to Middleware

Middleware is a component that is assembled into the application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Middlewares are chained one after another and execute in the same sequence in which they're added.

Middleware can be a request delegate (anonymous method or lambda expression) or a class.

## Middleware - Run

The `Run` extension method is used to execute a terminating or short-circuiting middleware that doesnâ€™t forward the request to the next middleware.

```csharp
app.Run(async (HttpContext context) =>
{
    //code
});
```

## Middleware Chain

### Use

The `Use` extension method is used to execute non-terminating middleware that may or may not forward the request to the next middleware.

```csharp
app.Use(async (HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next) =>
{
    //before logic
    await next(context);
    //after logic
});
```

## Middleware Class

A middleware class is used to separate the middleware logic from a lambda expression to a separate reusable class.

```csharp
class MiddlewareClassName : IMiddleware
{
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
    {
        //before logic
        await next(context);
        //after logic
    }
}
app.UseMiddleware<MiddlewareClassName>();
```

## Middleware Extensions

Middleware extension methods are used to invoke middleware with a single method call.

```csharp
static class ClassName
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder ExtensionMethodName(this IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        return app.UseMiddleware<MiddlewareClassName>();
    }
}
app.ExtensionMethodName();
```

## Conventional Middleware

Conventional middleware is a simple yet powerful way to encapsulate custom logic for processing HTTP requests and responses.

```csharp
class MiddlewareClassName
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
  
    public MiddlewareClassName(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }
  
    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        //before logic
        await _next(context);
        //after logic
    }
}

static class ClassName
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder ExtensionMethodName(this IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        return app.UseMiddleware<MiddlewareClassName>();
    }
}
app.ExtensionMethodName();
```

## The Right Order of Middleware

The order in which middleware components are added to the request pipeline is crucial for ensuring correct application behavior:

```csharp
app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
app.UseHsts();
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseCors();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.UseSession();
app.MapControllers();
// Add your custom middlewares
app.Run();
```

## Middleware - UseWhen

The `UseWhen` extension method is used to execute a branch of middleware only when the specified condition is true.

```csharp
app.UseWhen(
  context => { return boolean; },
  app =>
  {
    // Add your middlewares
  }
);
```

By following this guide, you can effectively manage the flow of HTTP requests and responses through your ASP.NET Core application using middleware.
