# ASP.NET Core Middleware Example

This lecture demonstrates the basic usage of ASP.NET Core middleware by creating a simple ASP.NET Core project.

## Project Setup

- **Project Name**: Middleware Example
- **Location**: C:\ASP.NET Core
- **Framework**: .NET 6
- **HTTPS Configuration**: Disabled for this demonstration.

## Configuring Middleware

In the `Program.cs` file, you configure application middleware using the application builder object (`app`), which is obtained after calling the build method.

### Creating Middleware

Middleware is created in the sequence you want them to execute. One method to create middleware is the `Run` method.

#### Lambda Expression

- The `Run` method defines a lambda expression executed upon receiving a request.
- This lambda expression executes only when a request is received, not at application startup.
- It takes an argument called `context` of type `HttpContext`, which contains properties such as request, response, and session.

Example:
```csharp
app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello");
});
```

- The `WriteAsync` method sends a response back to the browser, and `await` is used to ensure execution waits for completion.

### Asynchronous Execution

- The lambda expression is asynchronous and contains one or more `await` statements to efficiently use server resources.
- The `await` keyword can only be used within asynchronous methods.

## Execution and Debugging

- Running the application will display "Hello" as a response.
- Breakpoints can be used to pause execution at specific lines for debugging.

### Multiple `app.Run` Methods

- You can technically create multiple `app.Run` methods, but they won't execute sequentially.
- The `app.Run` method does not forward requests to subsequent middleware, which means only the first `app.Run` executes.

### Key Point

- The `app.Run` method creates terminal or short-circuiting middleware, which does not forward requests to the next middleware.

## Conclusion

- The fundamental design goal of middleware is to allow forwarding requests to subsequent middleware.
- `app.Run` creates terminating middleware, but other methods allow creating a chain of middleware.
- Further lectures will explore creating a chain of middleware for sequential execution.
