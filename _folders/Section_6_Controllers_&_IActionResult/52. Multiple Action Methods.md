# Multiple Action Methods in ASP.NET Core

## Introduction
In ASP.NET Core, you can define multiple routes for the same action method and create multiple action methods within a single controller. This provides flexibility in how you map URLs to specific actions in your application.

## Defining Multiple Routes for an Action Method
When you run an application and encounter a 404 error due to an undefined route, you can overcome this by defining a route for an empty URL, such as "/". This allows you to execute a specific action method when the route path is empty.

### Example:
You can add multiple routes like "sayhello1" and "sayhello2" for the same action method. These routes can both work and map to the same action method.

Similarly, you can add a route for "/" that will match the default URL (e.g., `localhost:<port>`), allowing the action method to execute.

### Code Example:
```csharp
[Route("/")]
[Route("sayhello")]
public IActionResult Index()
{
    return View();
}
```

In this example, the action method `Index` will work for both the default URL ("/") and the "sayhello" URL.

## Creating Multiple Action Methods
In real-world projects, it is common to have multiple action methods corresponding to different pages or functionalities, such as a home page, about page, and contact page.

### Example:
```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    [Route("/")]
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }

    [Route("about")]
    public IActionResult About()
    {
        return View();
    }

    [Route("contact-us")]
    public IActionResult Contact()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Index` action method handles the default URL "/".
- The `About` action method handles the "about" URL.
- The `Contact` action method handles the "contact-us" URL.

## Customizing URL Templates
You can customize the URL template independently of the action method name. This allows for more descriptive and user-friendly URLs.

### Example:
```csharp
[Route("home-page")]
public IActionResult Index()
{
    return View();
}
```

In this case, even though the action method is named `Index`, the URL will be "home-page".

## Route Parameters and Constraints
ASP.NET Core supports route parameters and constraints, allowing for dynamic and flexible routing.

### Example:
```csharp
[Route("contact-us/{mobile:int}")]
public IActionResult Contact(int mobile)
{
    return View();
}
```

This route requires a 10-digit mobile number and will only match URLs that provide a valid number.

## Summary
Multiple action methods and route configurations in ASP.NET Core enable developers to create flexible and maintainable web applications. By defining multiple routes, customizing URL templates, and using route parameters, you can tailor the behavior of your application to meet various requirements.
