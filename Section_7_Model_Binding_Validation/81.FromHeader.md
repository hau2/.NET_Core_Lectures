# Reading Request Headers in ASP.NET Core

## Overview
In ASP.NET Core, you can use the `[FromHeader]` attribute to bind values directly from the request headers into your action method parameters. This allows for easier access to common HTTP headers like `User-Agent`, `Authorization`, or any custom headers that your application may rely on.

### Example Scenario: Reading the User-Agent Header
In this example, we are binding the `User-Agent` request header to a parameter in the controller action. The `User-Agent` header provides information about the client's browser and operating system.

Hereâ€™s how we define the action method to handle this:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    [Route("register")]
    public IActionResult Index(Person person, [FromHeader(Name = "User-Agent")] string UserAgent)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            string errors = string.Join("\n", ModelState.Values.SelectMany(value => value.Errors).Select(err => err.ErrorMessage));
            return BadRequest(errors);
        }

        return Content($"{person}, {UserAgent}");
    }
}
```

### How Header Binding Works
By using the `[FromHeader]` attribute, you can specify the exact name of the header you want to bind. In this example, we are binding the `User-Agent` header, which contains details about the browser or client making the request.

When the request is processed, ASP.NET Core will automatically retrieve the value of the `User-Agent` header and assign it to the `UserAgent` parameter. This is done without the need for additional code to manually retrieve headers from the request context.

### Example Request
Here is an example of how this might work in practice. When a client (such as a web browser or Postman) makes a request to the `/register` endpoint, the `User-Agent` header is included in the request:

```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
```

The value of this header will automatically be bound to the `UserAgent` parameter in the action method, and you can then use it within your controller logic.

### Conclusion
Using the `[FromHeader]` attribute in ASP.NET Core provides a simple way to bind request headers directly to action method parameters. This can be especially useful for working with authentication tokens, browser information, and other metadata commonly included in HTTP headers.
