# Detailed Explanation of Query String and Route Data in ASP.NET Core

### 1. Introduction
In ASP.NET Core, model binding is a powerful feature that automatically maps values from various parts of the HTTP request to the parameters of action methods. This simplifies the handling of input data without having to write manual code for each case. In this article, we focus on two key data sources: **Route Data** and **Query String**.

### 2. Model Binding Process
Model binding occurs before the controller action method is executed. When a URL matches a specific route, ASP.NET Core begins the model binding process, automatically retrieving data from different sources like route data and query string and mapping them to the parameters of the action method.

### 3. Route Data
- **Route Data**: This is the data passed in the URL as route parameters, typically defined in the URL paths using curly braces `{}`.
- At runtime, the values provided in the URL are processed as route data.
- Route data has **higher priority** than query string data during model binding.

#### Example of Route Data:
Suppose we have the following route: `/book/{id}/{title}`, and a user visits the URL `/book/123/learn-aspnet-core`. The `id` value will be `123`, and the `title` will be `learn-aspnet-core`. This is a typical example of route data.

```csharp
public IActionResult GetBookDetails(int id, string title)
{
    return Content($"Book ID: {id}, Title: {title}");
}
```

### 4. Query String Parameters
- **Query String Parameters**: These are key-value pairs appended to the URL after the `?` and are commonly used in GET requests.
- Query strings are processed after route data in the model binding process, and they can be retrieved without manually accessing the `request.query` object.

#### Example of Query String:
If a user visits the URL `/book/details?id=123&title=learn-aspnet-core`, the query string parameters would be `id=123` and `title=learn-aspnet-core`. They are passed into the action method through model binding.

```csharp
public IActionResult GetBookDetails(int id, string title)
{
    return Content($"Book ID: {id}, Title: {title}");
}
```

### 5. Priority Comparison between Route Data and Query String
By default, model binding processes data in the following order of precedence:
1. Route Data
2. Query String

This means that if both route data and query string provide the same value, the value from route data will be used.

#### Example of Comparison:
```csharp
[HttpGet("/book/{id}")]
public IActionResult GetBookDetails(int id, [FromQuery] string title)
{
    // The id will be retrieved from the route, while the title is from the query string.
    return Content($"Book ID: {id}, Title: {title}");
}
```
With the URL `/book/123?title=learn-aspnet-core`, the action method will receive the `id` from route data (`123`) and the `title` from the query string (`learn-aspnet-core`).

### 6. Customizing Binding Sources
If you want to change the default behavior and explicitly specify the source for each parameter, you can use attributes like `[FromRoute]` and `[FromQuery]`. This ensures that data is retrieved from the correct source.

#### Example of Customization:
```csharp
public IActionResult GetBookDetails([FromRoute] int id, [FromQuery] string title)
{
    return Content($"Book ID: {id}, Title: {title}");
}
```
In this example, the `id` will always be retrieved from the route, and `title` will always come from the query string, even if both are present in both sources.

### 7. Handling Missing Values
In cases where values are not provided from either source, the parameters can accept `null`. You can use nullable types to handle such scenarios more flexibly.

#### Example of Nullable:
```csharp
public IActionResult GetBookDetails(int? bookId)
{
    if (!bookId.HasValue || bookId <= 0)
    {
        return BadRequest("Book ID is invalid or not provided.");
    }

    return Content($"Book ID: {bookId.Value}");
}
```
In this example, if the `bookId` is not provided in the URL, the variable will have a `null` value, and the action method can handle this case appropriately.

### 8. Automatic Model Binding Process
Once model binding completes, the action method is executed with the bound values. Model binding allows developers to avoid writing long and complex code to retrieve data from the HTTP request, as the data is already ready to use in the action method's parameters.

### 9. Conclusion
Model binding in ASP.NET Core is a useful tool that simplifies the handling of data from HTTP requests. It automates the process of mapping data from route data and query strings to action method parameters. With flexible customization options, model binding allows you to control the data retrieval process and ensures that your code is concise and maintainable.

Whether working with route data or query strings, model binding reduces complexity and helps you focus on the core logic of your application.
