# Detailed Explanation of Custom Validation with Multiple Properties in ASP.NET Core

### 1. Introduction
In ASP.NET Core, custom validation is often used to validate individual properties in a model. However, there are scenarios where you need to validate multiple properties together. For example, in a registration form, you may need to ensure that two dates are in the correct sequence (e.g., `StartDate` should be before `EndDate`). This requires custom validation that can compare values across multiple properties.

By creating custom validation attributes, you can implement logic to compare multiple properties, ensuring that the validation logic is centralized, reusable, and maintainable.

### 2. Scenario: Validating Date Ranges
A common example of custom validation across multiple properties is validating date ranges. For instance, in a form that displays transactions between two dates, you need to ensure that the `FromDate` is earlier than the `ToDate`. This is not something that built-in validation attributes can handle, so we need to create a custom validation attribute.

The custom validation attribute will be applied to the `ToDate` property and compare it with the `FromDate` property.

### 3. Creating a Custom Validation Attribute for Date Ranges
Custom validation attributes for multiple properties follow the same basic approach as single-property validation but involve additional steps to access and compare other properties. You will need to override the `IsValid` method and use reflection to fetch values of other properties dynamically.

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Create the Custom Attribute**: Define a new class that inherits from `ValidationAttribute`.
2. **Override IsValid**: In the `IsValid` method, access both properties (e.g., `FromDate` and `ToDate`) and implement the comparison logic.
3. **Use Reflection**: Access the value of the other property using reflection since it won't be directly accessible.

### 4. Implementing the Date Range Validator
The custom `DateRangeValidatorAttribute` will be applied to the `ToDate` property and compare its value with the `FromDate` property.

#### Example Code:
```csharp
public class DateRangeValidatorAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
    public string OtherPropertyName { get; }

    public DateRangeValidatorAttribute(string otherPropertyName)
    {
        OtherPropertyName = otherPropertyName;
    }

    protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        // Get the value of the property this attribute is applied to (ToDate)
        if (value == null || !(value is DateTime toDate))
        {
            return ValidationResult.Success;
        }

        // Get the value of the other property (FromDate) using reflection
        var otherProperty = validationContext.ObjectType.GetProperty(OtherPropertyName);
        if (otherProperty == null)
        {
            return new ValidationResult($"Property '{OtherPropertyName}' not found.");
        }

        var fromDate = (DateTime)otherProperty.GetValue(validationContext.ObjectInstance);

        // Compare the two dates
        if (fromDate > toDate)
        {
            return new ValidationResult("FromDate should be earlier than ToDate.");
        }

        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }
}
```
In this example, the `DateRangeValidatorAttribute` compares the `FromDate` and `ToDate` properties. The attribute uses reflection to access the value of the `FromDate` property dynamically and then compares the two dates.

### 5. Applying the Custom Validation Attribute
Once the custom validation attribute is defined, you can apply it to your model properties. This is done just like any other validation attribute.

#### Example Usage:
```csharp
public class Transaction
{
    public DateTime FromDate { get; set; }

    [DateRangeValidator("FromDate", ErrorMessage = "ToDate must be after FromDate.")]
    public DateTime ToDate { get; set; }
}
```
In this model, the `ToDate` property is validated against the `FromDate` property using the `DateRangeValidatorAttribute`. If `ToDate` is earlier than `FromDate`, a validation error will be generated.

### 6. Enhancing the Validation Logic
In more complex scenarios, you may need to handle additional conditions or support validation across multiple fields. You can further enhance the validation logic by providing more detailed error messages or validating against more than two properties.

#### Example: Customizing Error Messages
You can make the validation attribute more flexible by providing custom error messages or adding default behaviors.

```csharp
protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
{
    // Get the value of the ToDate property
    if (value == null || !(value is DateTime toDate))
    {
        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }

    // Access the FromDate property
    var otherProperty = validationContext.ObjectType.GetProperty(OtherPropertyName);
    if (otherProperty == null)
    {
        return new ValidationResult($"Property '{OtherPropertyName}' not found.");
    }

    var fromDate = (DateTime)otherProperty.GetValue(validationContext.ObjectInstance);

    // Validate the date range
    if (fromDate > toDate)
    {
        var errorMessage = ErrorMessage ?? $"FromDate ({fromDate:dd/MM/yyyy}) must be earlier than ToDate ({toDate:dd/MM/yyyy}).";
        return new ValidationResult(errorMessage);
    }

    return ValidationResult.Success;
}
```
In this example, the error message is customized to include the actual values of `FromDate` and `ToDate`, providing more context to the user.

### 7. Reflection and ValidationContext
The `ValidationContext` object provides essential information about the model being validated. It includes properties such as `ObjectType` and `ObjectInstance`, which allow you to access the type and instance of the model being validated. Reflection is used to retrieve the values of properties dynamically.

#### Reflection Example:
```csharp
var propertyInfo = validationContext.ObjectType.GetProperty(OtherPropertyName);
if (propertyInfo != null)
{
    var otherValue = propertyInfo.GetValue(validationContext.ObjectInstance);
    // Logic to validate otherValue with the current property value
}
```
This technique is especially useful when validating multiple properties, as it allows you to dynamically access and compare property values.

### 8. Conclusion
Custom validation across multiple properties is an essential technique in ASP.NET Core when the built-in attributes are insufficient. By using custom validation attributes, reflection, and the `ValidationContext`, you can implement flexible validation rules that compare values across different fields. This approach centralizes the validation logic, making it reusable and maintainable throughout your application.
