# Using IValidatableObject for Custom Model Validation in ASP.NET Core

### 1. Introduction
Sometimes, a model may require custom validation that is specific to a particular scenario and does not need to be reused. In such cases, ASP.NET Core provides the `IValidatableObject` interface. This allows you to write custom validation logic directly inside the model class itself, making it simple and specific to the use case.

The `IValidatableObject` interface defines a single method called `Validate`. This method is called after model binding and after all property-level validations have passed. You can implement this method to add custom validation logic that applies to multiple properties within the same model.

### 2. Scenario Example: Validating Date of Birth and Age
A common use case for custom model validation is when there are interdependent properties in a model. For instance, you might want to ensure that either a `DateOfBirth` or `Age` is provided in a model, but not both. This scenario can be handled using the `IValidatableObject` interface.

Instead of creating a reusable custom validation attribute, you can implement the validation logic within the model class itself.

### 3. Implementing IValidatableObject in a Model
To use `IValidatableObject`, you need to implement the interface and define the `Validate` method in your model. This method will contain the validation logic for the entire model.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Person : IValidatableObject
{
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }

    public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        // Ensure that either DateOfBirth or Age is provided but not both
        if (DateOfBirth.HasValue && Age.HasValue)
        {
            yield return new ValidationResult("Either Date of Birth or Age should be supplied, not both.", new[] { nameof(Age) });
        }
        else if (!DateOfBirth.HasValue && !Age.HasValue)
        {
            yield return new ValidationResult("Either Date of Birth or Age must be supplied.", new[] { nameof(Age), nameof(DateOfBirth) });
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the model class `Person` implements `IValidatableObject` and contains the custom validation logic inside the `Validate` method. The method uses `yield return` to return one or more `ValidationResult` objects, which contain the validation error message.

### 4. Benefits of IValidatableObject
- **Model-Specific Validation**: Since the validation is written inside the model class, it is specific to the business rules of that model.
- **No Reflection Needed**: Unlike creating reusable validation attributes, using `IValidatableObject` does not require reflection.
- **Simplicity**: It's simple to implement and does not require creating separate validation classes.

### 5. Handling Validation Execution
ASP.NET Core automatically calls the `Validate` method after all property-level validations have passed. This ensures that any custom validation logic inside the model class is only executed if the basic property validations are clear of errors.

### 6. Yielding Multiple Validation Results
The return type of the `Validate` method is `IEnumerable<ValidationResult>`, which means that you can return multiple validation results from a single method.

#### Example:
```csharp
public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Name))
    {
        yield return new ValidationResult("Name is required.", new[] { nameof(Name) });
    }

    if (DateOfBirth.HasValue && Age.HasValue)
    {
        yield return new ValidationResult("Either Date of Birth or Age should be supplied, not both.", new[] { nameof(Age) });
    }
}
```
This allows you to handle multiple custom validation checks in a single model class.

### 7. Conclusion
The `IValidatableObject` interface is a powerful tool for implementing custom validation logic directly within a model class. It is ideal for scenarios where validation logic is specific to a particular model and does not need to be reused across different models. By leveraging the `Validate` method, you can implement complex validation rules that apply to multiple properties in the model, ensuring that the data conforms to your application's requirements.
