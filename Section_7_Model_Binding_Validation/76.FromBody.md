# Using FromBody in ASP.NET Core

### 1. Introduction
In ASP.NET Core, model binding typically binds data from form fields, route data, and query string parameters. However, when dealing with content types other than form data, such as JSON, CSV, or XML, you need to use the `FromBody` attribute. This attribute tells ASP.NET Core to bind data from the request body rather than from form fields or query parameters.

### 2. Content Types and Request Body
Form fields are typically sent as either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`. These are standard content types used by HTML forms, and ASP.NET Core handles them as form fields during model binding. However, for content types like `application/json`, `application/xml`, or custom formats, data must be read from the request body. This is where the `FromBody` attribute comes into play.

#### Example of Supported Content Types:
- `application/json`: Used for sending JSON data.
- `application/xml`: Used for sending XML data.
- `application/csv`: Used for sending CSV data.

These content types require the request body model binding, and `FromBody` enables this functionality.

### 3. Using FromBody with JSON Data
When you want to receive JSON or XML data, you apply the `FromBody` attribute to the model parameter in the action method. This enables ASP.NET Core to parse the request body and convert the JSON or XML data into the specified model object using input formatters.

#### Example Code:
```csharp
public IActionResult Register([FromBody] Person person)
{
    // The person parameter will be populated with data from the request body (JSON or XML)
}
```
Here, the `FromBody` attribute is applied to the `person` parameter, allowing ASP.NET Core to read JSON data from the request body and convert it into a `Person` model object.

### 4. Sending JSON Data with Postman
To test this functionality, you can use a tool like Postman. When sending data, select the **Body** tab in Postman and choose **raw** format. Instead of sending `form-data` or `x-www-form-urlencoded`, select `JSON` as the format. Then, you can enter key-value pairs in JSON format.

#### Example JSON Data:
```json
{
    "personName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890"
}
```
When the request is made, the `FromBody` attribute will enable ASP.NET Core to use the JSON input formatter to convert this JSON data into a `Person` object.

### 5. Input Formatters and Model Binding
Input formatters are responsible for converting the data from the request body into the appropriate model object. By using the `FromBody` attribute, you instruct ASP.NET Core to use the appropriate input formatter (such as JSON or XML formatter) based on the content type of the request.

If the `FromBody` attribute is not applied, ASP.NET Core will not look at the request body for data and will not bind the JSON or XML data to the model.

### 6. Conclusion
The `FromBody` attribute in ASP.NET Core allows you to bind model parameters from the request body when dealing with content types like JSON, XML, or custom formats. By using input formatters, ASP.NET Core converts the request body data into the specified model object, making it easy to handle different types of content in your API or web application.
