# Bind and BindNever in ASP.NET Core

### 1. Introduction
The `Bind` and `BindNever` attributes in ASP.NET Core are used to control which properties are included or excluded during model binding. Model binding automatically maps form data or query parameters to model properties. However, there are situations where you may want to limit which properties are bound to avoid issues like overposting or unintended data manipulation.

### 2. The Bind Attribute
The `Bind` attribute allows you to specify exactly which properties should be included during model binding. By default, all properties of a model class are included, but using the `Bind` attribute helps limit this to specific properties.

#### Example Usage
Consider a registration form where only certain fields such as `PersonName`, `Email`, `Password`, and `ConfirmPassword` should be submitted. If a hacker or malicious website tries to submit additional fields, using the `Bind` attribute ensures only the desired fields are processed.

#### Example Code:
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string PersonName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public string ConfirmPassword { get; set; }
    public string Phone { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}
```

In the controller, you can specify the properties to bind using the `Bind` attribute.

```csharp
public IActionResult Register([Bind("PersonName,Email,Password,ConfirmPassword")] Person person)
{
    // Only PersonName, Email, Password, and ConfirmPassword are bound
}
```

In this example, only the specified properties will be included during model binding. Any other properties, such as `Phone` and `DateOfBirth`, will not be included even if they are submitted.

### 3. The BindNever Attribute
While the `Bind` attribute allows you to specify which properties to include, the `BindNever` attribute is used when you want to exclude specific properties from being bound, while allowing the rest of the properties to be included.

This is useful when you have a model with many properties, and you only want to exclude one or two properties from model binding.

#### Example Usage
Suppose you have a `Person` model with 15 properties, but you want to exclude the `DateOfBirth` property from being bound.

#### Example Code:
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string PersonName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }

    [BindNever]
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}
```

In this case, all properties of the `Person` model will be bound except `DateOfBirth` because the `BindNever` attribute prevents it from being included in the model binding.

### 4. Scenarios for Using Bind and BindNever
- **Overposting Prevention**: Using the `Bind` attribute can help prevent overposting attacks, where malicious users submit more fields than intended.
- **Enhanced Security**: Both `Bind` and `BindNever` can enhance security by controlling exactly which data is processed and stored.
- **Selective Binding**: The `BindNever` attribute provides a convenient way to exclude a small number of properties when you want most of the model's properties to be bound.

### 5. Conclusion
The `Bind` and `BindNever` attributes provide fine-grained control over which model properties are included or excluded during model binding in ASP.NET Core. By carefully selecting which properties to bind, you can improve security, prevent overposting, and ensure that only the intended data is processed by your application.
