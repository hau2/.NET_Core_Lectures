# Custom Model Binders in ASP.NET Core

## Overview
In ASP.NET Core, model binding is the process by which incoming HTTP request data is automatically mapped to action method parameters. By default, ASP.NET Core uses built-in model binders for common types like strings, integers, and complex objects (e.g., classes). However, there are times when the default behavior does not meet the needs of a more complex scenario. This is where custom model binders come into play.

Custom model binders allow developers to handle complex model binding scenarios by overriding the default logic and providing custom behavior. They are particularly useful when you need to bind non-standard data formats, apply specific logic during the binding process, or handle more complex data transformations.

### Why Use Custom Model Binders?
In most real-world projects, the default model binders are sufficient. However, custom model binders are necessary when you encounter situations such as:
- **Complex Data Structures**: When the request data does not directly map to the model's properties, e.g., concatenating first name and last name into a single `PersonName`.
- **Custom Data Types**: Handling custom data types like enums, structs, or composite data formats.
- **Advanced Logic**: When model binding involves applying transformations, such as converting a string to a custom format or interpreting complex nested JSON.

For example, let's say you have a form that submits `FirstName` and `LastName` fields separately, but you want to store them as a single `PersonName` in the model. This scenario requires a custom model binder.

### Example: Combining First and Last Name
In this example, we are working with a `Person` model, which contains a property called `PersonName`. Instead of sending `PersonName` directly from the client, we are receiving `FirstName` and `LastName` separately and then combining them into the `PersonName` field using a custom model binder.

The custom model binder takes care of binding the incoming data, performing the concatenation, and passing the final object to the action method.

### Custom Model Binder Implementation
To create a custom model binder, you need to implement the `IModelBinder` interface. The interface requires the implementation of the `BindModelAsync` method, where you define your custom logic.

Here is a full implementation of a custom model binder:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding;
using ModelValidationsExample.Models;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace ModelValidationsExample.CustomModelBinders
{
  public class PersonModelBinder : IModelBinder
  {
    public Task BindModelAsync(ModelBindingContext bindingContext)
    {
      // Create an instance of the Person model
      Person person = new Person();

      // Bind FirstName
      if (bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("FirstName").Length > 0)
      {
        person.PersonName = bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("FirstName").FirstValue;

        // Optionally bind LastName and concatenate
        if (bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("LastName").Length > 0)
        {
          person.PersonName += " " + bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("LastName").FirstValue;
        }
      }

      // Bind Email
      if (bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("Email").Length > 0)
      {
        person.Email = bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("Email").FirstValue;
      }

      // Bind Phone
      if (bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("Phone").Length > 0)
      {
        person.Phone = bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("Phone").FirstValue;
      }

      // Mark the model binding as successful and return the model
      bindingContext.Result = ModelBindingResult.Success(person);
      return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
  }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation
- **Person Object Creation**: The `PersonModelBinder` creates an instance of the `Person` model.
- **Binding First and Last Name**: The binder checks for the presence of `FirstName` and `LastName` in the request data. If both are present, it concatenates them with a space and assigns the result to the `PersonName` property.
- **Binding Other Properties**: The custom binder also binds other properties like `Email` and `Phone` by extracting their values from the request using the `ValueProvider`.
- **Result Assignment**: After all values have been assigned to the `Person` object, the binder sets the binding result to success and returns the completed `Person` model.

### Applying the Custom Model Binder in the Controller
Once the custom model binder is created, it must be applied to the action method in the controller. This is done by using the `[ModelBinder]` attribute and specifying the `BinderType` parameter.

Here's an example of how the binder is applied in the `HomeController`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using ModelValidationsExample.Models;
using ModelValidationsExample.CustomModelBinders;

namespace ModelValidationsExample.Controllers
{
  public class HomeController : Controller
  {
    [Route("register")]
    public IActionResult Index([FromBody] [ModelBinder(BinderType = typeof(PersonModelBinder))] Person person)
    {
      if (!ModelState.IsValid)
      {
        // Collect and return validation error messages
        string errors = string.Join("\n", ModelState.Values.SelectMany(value => value.Errors).Select(err => err.ErrorMessage));
        return BadRequest(errors);
      }

      // If valid, return the concatenated PersonName
      return Content($"{person.PersonName}");
    }
  }
}
```

### How It Works
- **Custom Model Binder in Action**: When the `Index` method is invoked, the custom model binder is executed instead of the default binder. The binder takes the incoming data, performs the necessary operations, and passes the modified model to the controller.
- **Model Validation**: Even with custom model binders, the standard ASP.NET Core model validation still applies. The model is validated against any validation attributes applied to the properties (e.g., `[Required]`, `[EmailAddress]`), ensuring that only valid data is processed.

### Advanced Scenarios
Custom model binders are versatile and can be extended to handle more complex scenarios:
- **Multiple Parameters Binding**: You can bind multiple parameters simultaneously, applying custom logic to each one.
- **Custom Data Formats**: Model binders can parse custom formats, such as combining date and time fields or decoding specific data formats from request bodies.
- **Conditional Logic**: You can add conditional logic based on the content or structure of the request, such as handling different input formats (e.g., form data, JSON, XML).

### Conclusion
Custom model binders in ASP.NET Core provide flexibility when default model binding does not suffice. They allow you to control how incoming data is processed and mapped to your models, making it possible to handle complex data transformations and custom data structures. While the need for custom model binders is rare, they are invaluable when you need greater control over the binding process.

By understanding how custom model binders work, you can implement solutions that handle advanced scenarios, ensuring that your application's model binding logic remains clean and adaptable.
