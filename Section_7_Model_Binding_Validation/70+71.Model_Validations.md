# Detailed Explanation of All Model Validations in ASP.NET Core

### 1. Introduction
Model validation in ASP.NET Core is a crucial feature that ensures the data submitted by users conforms to the rules defined in your application. By using validation attributes directly on model properties, you can automatically enforce validation rules without writing manual validation code. This helps ensure that the data is reliable and adheres to the required formats, ranges, and conditions before processing.

ASP.NET Core provides various built-in validation attributes, such as `[Required]`, `[Range]`, `[StringLength]`, `[RegularExpression]`, and more. These attributes are highly flexible, and developers can also create custom validation attributes to handle more complex scenarios.

### 2. Built-in Validation Attributes

#### 2.1 [Required]
The `[Required]` attribute ensures that a property must have a value. This is typically used for fields that cannot be left empty.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Person
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required.")]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
In this example, if the `Name` field is not provided, a validation error will occur, and the custom error message "Name is required." will be returned.

#### 2.2 [Range]
The `[Range]` attribute specifies that a property's value must fall within a certain range. This is often used for numerical data, such as prices, quantities, or scores.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Product
{
    [Range(1, 100, ErrorMessage = "Price must be between 1 and 100.")]
    public double Price { get; set; }
}
```
Here, the `Price` property must be between 1 and 100. If a value outside this range is submitted, a validation error is triggered.

#### 2.3 [StringLength]
The `[StringLength]` attribute limits the length of a string. It is useful for fields like names, descriptions, or addresses, where the length needs to be controlled.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Book
{
    [StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = "Title cannot exceed 50 characters.")]
    public string Title { get; set; }
}
```
In this example, if the `Title` exceeds 50 characters, a validation error will be returned.

#### 2.4 [RegularExpression]
The `[RegularExpression]` attribute enforces that a property value matches a specific pattern. This is often used for fields like phone numbers, social security numbers, or zip codes.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    [RegularExpression(@"^[A-Za-z\s\.]+$", ErrorMessage = "Name must contain only letters, spaces, and dots.")]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
In this case, the `Name` field must contain only letters, spaces, and dots. Any other characters will cause a validation error.

### 3. Specialized Validation Attributes

#### 3.1 [EmailAddress]
The `[EmailAddress]` attribute is specifically designed for validating email addresses. It simplifies the process by checking the format of the email without the need for a custom regular expression.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Contact
{
    [EmailAddress(ErrorMessage = "Invalid email address.")]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```
This ensures that the `Email` property follows a valid email format.

#### 3.2 [Phone]
The `[Phone]` attribute validates that the property contains a valid phone number. It is commonly used in contact forms or profile information.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Contact
{
    [Phone(ErrorMessage = "Invalid phone number.")]
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
}
```
This ensures that the `PhoneNumber` property follows a valid phone number format.

### 4. Compare Attribute for Matching Values
The `[Compare]` attribute is used to compare the values of two properties, such as ensuring that a "Password" and "Confirm Password" match in registration forms.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class RegisterViewModel
{
    [Required]
    public string Password { get; set; }

    [Compare("Password", ErrorMessage = "Passwords do not match.")]
    public string ConfirmPassword { get; set; }
}
```
In this example, the `ConfirmPassword` field must match the `Password` field. If the values are different, a validation error is triggered.

### 5. Validating URLs and Disabling Validation

#### 5.1 [Url]
The `[Url]` attribute ensures that a property contains a valid URL. This is useful when users are submitting website links or API endpoints.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Website
{
    [Url(ErrorMessage = "Invalid website URL.")]
    public string WebsiteUrl { get; set; }
}
```
This ensures that the `WebsiteUrl` follows the correct format for a URL.

#### 5.2 [ValidateNever]
In some cases, you may want to temporarily disable validation for specific properties. You can use the `[ValidateNever]` attribute to exclude the property from validation checks.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class User
{
    [ValidateNever]
    public string TemporaryData { get; set; }
}
```
This disables validation for the `TemporaryData` property.

### 6. Custom Validation Attributes
When none of the built-in validation attributes meet your requirements, you can create custom validation attributes by inheriting from `ValidationAttribute` and overriding the `IsValid` method.

#### Example of Custom Validation:
```csharp
public class ValidateYearAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
    public int MinYear { get; }

    public ValidateYearAttribute(int minYear)
    {
        MinYear = minYear;
    }

    protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (value is int year && year >= MinYear)
        {
            return ValidationResult.Success;
        }
        return new ValidationResult($"Year must be greater than {MinYear}.");
    }
}
```

In this custom validation attribute, the year must be greater than or equal to the specified `MinYear`. If the validation fails, an error message is returned.

### 7. Conclusion
Model validation attributes in ASP.NET Core provide a powerful and flexible way to enforce data integrity in your application. By using built-in attributes such as `[Required]`, `[Range]`, `[RegularExpression]`, and `[Compare]`, you can easily validate common data formats and conditions. When necessary, you can extend validation with custom attributes, ensuring that even complex validation rules are met before data is processed. This results in cleaner, more maintainable code and improves the overall reliability of your application.
