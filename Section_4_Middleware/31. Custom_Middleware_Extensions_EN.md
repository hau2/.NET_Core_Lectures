## Overview of Middleware in ASP.NET Core

Middleware is a key component of the ASP.NET Core pipeline, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. Middleware components are executed in a specific sequence, and each component can perform operations before and after the next component in the pipeline.

## Key Concepts

1. **Middleware**: A piece of code that processes requests and responses. Middleware components are chained together to form a pipeline, allowing each piece to perform its operation before passing the request to the next component.

2. **Request Delegate**: A function that can process an HTTP request. Middleware uses these delegates to define the sequence of operations that will be executed.

3. **Extension Methods**: Static methods that add functionality to existing types. In the context of middleware, extension methods are used to integrate custom middleware into the ASP.NET Core pipeline.

## Custom Middleware Implementation

Let's break down the code provided in `MyCustomMiddleware.cs` and `Program.cs`.

### `MyCustomMiddleware.cs`

This file contains the implementation of a custom middleware class and an extension method to add it to the pipeline.

```csharp
namespace MiddlewareExample.CustomMiddleware
{
    // Custom middleware class implementing the IMiddleware interface
    public class MyCustomMiddleware : IMiddleware
    {
        // The method invoked by the middleware pipeline
        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)
        {
            // Executes before the next middleware
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("My Custom Middleware - Starts\n");
            
            // Calls the next middleware in the pipeline
            await next(context);
            
            // Executes after the next middleware
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("My Custom Middleware - Ends\n");
        }
    }

    // Extension method to add the custom middleware to the pipeline
    public static class CustomMiddlewareExtension
    {
        // Method that adds MyCustomMiddleware to the app's middleware pipeline
        public static IApplicationBuilder UseMyCustomMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            return app.UseMiddleware<MyCustomMiddleware>();
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Class `MyCustomMiddleware`**: Implements the `IMiddleware` interface, which requires defining the `InvokeAsync` method. This method is responsible for handling HTTP requests.
  - **`InvokeAsync` Method**: 
    - Logs a message "My Custom Middleware - Starts" to indicate the start of the middleware.
    - Calls `await next(context)` to pass the control to the next middleware in the pipeline.
    - Logs a message "My Custom Middleware - Ends" after the subsequent middleware has executed.

- **Extension Method `UseMyCustomMiddleware`**:
  - Defined in a static class `CustomMiddlewareExtension`.
  - This method is an extension to `IApplicationBuilder`, allowing the custom middleware to be added to the ASP.NET Core pipeline using the `app.UseMyCustomMiddleware()` syntax.

### `Program.cs`

This file sets up the middleware pipeline and integrates the custom middleware.

```csharp
using MiddlewareExample.CustomMiddleware;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddTransient<MyCustomMiddleware>();
var app = builder.Build();

// Middleware 1
app.Use(async (HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("From Middleware 1\n");
    await next(context);
});

// Custom Middleware
app.UseMyCustomMiddleware();

// Middleware 3
app.Run(async (HttpContext context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("From Middleware 3");
});

app.Run();
```

**Explanation:**

- **Dependency Injection**: 
  - `builder.Services.AddTransient<MyCustomMiddleware>()` registers `MyCustomMiddleware` with the dependency injection container. This means a new instance of `MyCustomMiddleware` is created for each request.

- **Middleware Pipeline**:
  - **Middleware 1**: Logs "From Middleware 1" and calls the next middleware using `await next(context)`.
  - **Custom Middleware**: Integrated using the `app.UseMyCustomMiddleware()` method, which adds `MyCustomMiddleware` to the pipeline.
  - **Middleware 3**: Final middleware in the pipeline, logging "From Middleware 3".

## How the Middleware Pipeline Works

The middleware pipeline works by calling each middleware component in sequence. Each middleware can perform operations before and after calling the next middleware. Here's how the flow works in this example:

1. **Middleware 1** executes, logs its message, and calls `next`, which invokes the custom middleware.
2. **Custom Middleware** executes, logs its start message, calls `next` to invoke Middleware 3, and then logs its end message.
3. **Middleware 3** executes, logs its message, and completes the request.

## Benefits of Using Middleware

- **Centralized Request Handling**: Middleware provides a centralized place to handle requests, making it easier to manage and modify request handling logic.
- **Modularity**: Middleware components can be added or removed easily, promoting modular application design.
- **Reusability**: Middleware can be reused across multiple applications or components, reducing code duplication.

## Key Points to Remember

- Middleware is executed in the order it is added to the pipeline.
- The `next` delegate is crucial for passing control to the next middleware.
- Extension methods make it easy to integrate middleware and maintain clean code.

By understanding and implementing custom middleware in ASP.NET Core, you can enhance the flexibility and maintainability of your web applications, allowing for powerful request and response manipulation.
