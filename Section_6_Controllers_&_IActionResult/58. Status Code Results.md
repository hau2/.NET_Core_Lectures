# Status Code Results Overview

In the previous lecture, we discussed the use of status codes in HTTP responses and how they represent specific meanings. Here, we'll explore how to minimize repetitive code by using status code results in your application.

## Key Concepts

### Repetitive Code
In typical implementations, you might frequently write two statements:
1. Setting the status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
2. Returning the content result.

This repetitive pattern can be minimized using status code results.

### Status Code Results
Instead of manually setting the status code, you can return the appropriate status code result directly. Here are some common status codes:
- **400 (Bad Request):** Use `BadRequestResult`.
- **401 (Unauthorized):** Use `UnauthorizedResult`.
- **404 (Not Found):** Use `NotFoundResult`.
- **500 (Internal Server Error):** Use `StatusCodeResult`.

These classes simplify your code by allowing you to return the response with the specific status code without writing additional statements.

## Implementation Examples

### Bad Request (400)
For invalid incoming request details:
```csharp
return BadRequest("Invalid request details");
```

### Not Found (404)
For cases where the requested resource doesn't exist in the database:
```csharp
return NotFound("Resource not found");
```

### Unauthorized (401)
For cases where the user is not authenticated:
```csharp
return Unauthorized("User must be authenticated");
```

### Custom Status Codes
For other status codes, you can use:
```csharp
return StatusCode(500, "Internal Server Error");
```

### Practical Example
Consider a scenario where you need to handle different conditions based on the `bookId` supplied:
- If `bookId` is less than zero: return `BadRequest`.
- If `bookId` exceeds a certain value: return `BadRequest`.
- If the user is not logged in: return `Unauthorized`.
- If the resource is found and valid: return the resource (e.g., a PDF file).

Here's a simplified version:
```csharp
if(bookId < 0)
    return BadRequest("Book ID cannot be less than zero");

if(bookId > 1000)
    return BadRequest("Book ID cannot be greater than 1000");

if(!isLoggedIn)
    return Unauthorized("User must be authenticated");

return File("path/to/book.pdf", "application/pdf");
```

## Benefits of Status Code Results
Using status code results provides the following advantages:
- **Reduced Code Duplication:** No need to write separate statements for setting the status code.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that status codes are returned consistently across the application.
- **Clarity:** Makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

In the next lecture, we will explore the `RedirectResult` class and how to use it effectively.
