# Redirect Results - Part 2

In this lecture, we discussed additional types of redirections in an ASP.NET Core application. Below is a summary of the key points along with detailed differences between the redirection methods:

## Shortcut Methods for Redirections

### Temporary Redirection (302)
- **RedirectToAction**: This method is used to redirect from one action to another within the same application. It is a temporary redirection, meaning users can return to the original URL without any issues. The status code returned is typically **302 Found**, indicating that the resource is temporarily redirected to another URL.
- **Example**:
   ```csharp
   return RedirectToAction("Books", "Store", new { id = bookId });
   ```
   - **Advantages**: Easy to use, makes code maintenance simpler when you need to redirect to another action.
   - **Disadvantages**: The old URL is still used and can be cached by the browser.

### Permanent Redirection (301)
- **RedirectToActionPermanent**: Similar to `RedirectToAction`, but specifies that the redirection is permanent. The status code returned is **301 Moved Permanently**, indicating that the resource has been moved to a new URL permanently, and the old URL should no longer be used. Search engines will update their records with the new URL.
- **Example**:
   ```csharp
   return RedirectToActionPermanent("Books", "Store", new { id = bookId });
   ```
   - **Advantages**: Good for SEO, helps search engines understand that the old URL is no longer valid and should be replaced by the new URL.
   - **Disadvantages**: The old URL cannot be used again, as it has been permanently replaced.

### Local Redirect
- **LocalRedirectResult**: Used when you want to redirect to a local URL within the same application without specifying the action or controller names. This method only allows redirection to local URLs and returns a **302 Found** status code.
- **Example**:
   ```csharp
   return LocalRedirect("/store/books/" + bookId);
   ```
   - **Advantages**: Simplifies redirection when you know the exact URL you want to redirect to.
   - **Disadvantages**: Only applicable to local URLs, cannot redirect to a different domain.

### Permanent Local Redirect
- **LocalRedirectPermanent**: Similar to `LocalRedirect`, but specifies that the redirection is permanent, with a status code of **301 Moved Permanently**.
- **Example**:
   ```csharp
   return LocalRedirectPermanent("/store/books/" + bookId);
   ```
   - **Advantages**: Same as `LocalRedirect`, but better for SEO when you want to indicate that the old URL is no longer in use.
   - **Disadvantages**: The old URL will no longer work.

### Redirect Result
- **RedirectResult**: Used to redirect to any URL, including external domains. This method is more flexible when you need to redirect outside the scope of the current application. By default, it returns a **302 Found** status code but can be configured to return **301** for permanent redirections.
- **Example**:
   ```csharp
   return Redirect("https://example.com");
   ```
   - **Advantages**: Flexible, can be used to redirect to any website.
   - **Disadvantages**: Does not ensure that users will return to your application after redirection.

## Key Differences

- **Temporary vs. Permanent**: Methods with "Permanent" in their name will create a permanent redirection with a **301** status code, while others create temporary redirections with a **302** status code.
- **Local vs. External**: `LocalRedirect` and `LocalRedirectPermanent` only redirect within the same application, while `RedirectResult` can redirect to external URLs.

## Conclusion
Understanding these redirection methods helps you manage various scenarios in web applications, ensuring users are redirected correctly, whether within the same application or to an external site.
