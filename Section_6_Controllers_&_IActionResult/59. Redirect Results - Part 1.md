# Redirect Results - Part 1

In this lecture, we discussed how to handle URL redirection in an ASP.NET Core application. Here's a summary of the key points:

## Business Scenario

Imagine you started an online bookstore with a URL like `bookstore`. Over time, you expand your business to sell other products, leading to a more organized URL structure, such as:
- `store/books`
- `store/mobiles`
- `store/home-appliances`

However, the old `bookstore` URL is still bookmarked by existing customers. To avoid breaking these links, you need to redirect requests from `bookstore` to `store/books`.

## Understanding Redirection

When a request is made to the old URL (`bookstore`), you can redirect it to the new URL (`store/books`) using a redirection response. This involves returning a status code such as:
- **302 Found**: Temporary redirection.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Permanent redirection.

### Example Implementation

1. **Create a New Controller**: Suppose you have a new `StoreController` with an action method `Books`.
   ```csharp
   public class StoreController : Controller
   {
       public IActionResult Books()
       {
           return Content("Welcome to the Books section!");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Redirect from Old to New URL**: In your original controller (e.g., `HomeController`), after validation, you can redirect like this:
   ```csharp
   return RedirectToAction("Books", "Store");
   ```

3. **Handling Redirection**: When the old `bookstore` URL is accessed, the request is redirected to `store/books`. The new URL is then displayed in the browser's address bar.

### Handling Status Codes

- **302 Found**: Default for `RedirectToAction`. It indicates a temporary redirection.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: You can set this by adding a `permanent: true` argument to the `RedirectToAction` method:
   ```csharp
   return RedirectToAction("Books", "Store", new { }, permanent: true);
   ```

### Difference Between 302 and 301

- **302 (Temporary Redirection)**: The browser and search engines treat the redirection as temporary, and they don't update their cached URLs.
- **301 (Permanent Redirection)**: Browsers and search engines remember the new URL and update their records, replacing the old URL with the new one.

## Conclusion

Using redirection effectively ensures that your users are smoothly transitioned to the new URL structure without encountering broken links. In the next lecture, we will explore other redirection methods such as `RedirectResult` and `LocalRedirect`.
