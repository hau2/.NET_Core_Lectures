## Introduction to Controllers
- A controller is a class used to group up a set of actions (or action methods).
- Action methods perform certain operations when a request is received and return a result (response).

### Creating Controllers
- The class name should be suffixed with "Controller" (e.g., HomeController).
- The [Controller] attribute is applied to the class or its base class.

### Responsibilities of Controllers
- Reading requests and extracting data (query string parameters, request body, cookies, headers, etc.).
- Invoking models and calling business logic methods (often available as services).
- Validating incoming request details.
- Preparing and choosing what kind of response to send back.

### ContentResult
- Can represent any type of response based on the specified MIME type (e.g., text/plain, application/json).
- Example: `return new ContentResult() { Content = "content", ContentType = "content type" };`

### JsonResult
- Represents an object in JSON format.
- Example: `return new JsonResult(your_object);`

### File Results
- Sends the content of a file as a response.
- Types: `VirtualFileResult`, `PhysicalFileResult`, `FileContentResult`.

### IActionResult
- Parent interface for all action result classes like `ContentResult`, `JsonResult`, `StatusCodeResult`, etc.
- Allows flexibility in returning different result types.

### Status Code Results
- Sends an empty response with a specified status code (e.g., 200, 400, 404, 500).
- Example: `return new StatusCodeResult(status_code);`

### Redirect Results
- Redirects the browser with HTTP 302 or 301 response to another action or URL.
- Types: `RedirectToActionResult`, `LocalRedirectResult`, `RedirectResult`.
